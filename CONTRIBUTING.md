### 5. Create a Branch

Create a branch following our naming conventions (see [GIT.md](GIT.md)):

```bash
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b bug/your-bug-fix
# or
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-issue
```

### 6. Make Your Changes

## Coding Standards

### General

- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle

### JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use ES6+ syntax
- Use `const` by default, `let` when reassignment is needed
- Avoid `var`
- Use arrow functions for callbacks
- Use async/await instead of promise chains
- Use template literals for string interpolation

### React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the atomic design pattern (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates)
- Keep components small and reusable
- Use PropTypes or TypeScript for type checking
- Extract complex logic into custom hooks

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Write integration tests for API endpoints
- Aim for high test coverage (>80%)
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

### File Naming

- React components: `PascalCase.jsx` or `PascalCase.tsx`
- Utilities: `camelCase.js`
- Tests: `*.test.js` or `*.spec.js`
- Hooks: `useCamelCase.js`

## Commit Message Guidelines

We use a structured commit message format that provides context and reasoning for changes. For detailed guidelines, see [GIT.md](GIT.md).

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject> [<code>]

WHY:
<explanation of why this change is needed>

WHAT:
- <list of changes>
- <another change>

Web Impact:
<description of user-facing or application impact>

Failure Mode:
- <what to do if something goes wrong>
- <troubleshooting steps>
```

### Types

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that don't affect code meaning (formatting, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: Performance improvement
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools
- **ci**: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts

### Example

```bash
chore(docs): add initial project documentation and git setup [WRC1]

WHY:
Provide essential baseline documentation and project configuration files to guide 
contributors, ensure security awareness, define code of conduct, and establish git 
workflow conventions.

WHAT:
- Added README.md with project description, badges, and template sections
- Added CONTRIBUTING.md with guidelines for contributions and workflow
- Added SECURITY.md with security reporting instructions
- Added CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md with community behavior standards
- Added .gitignore and basic git configuration files

Web Impact:
- Gives contributors immediate guidance on contributing and security
- Provides a clear code of conduct to maintain community standards
- Establishes project structure for consistent git usage

Failure Mode:
- If contributors are unsure about contribution rules, refer to CONTRIBUTING.md
- If a security issue is found, follow the procedures in SECURITY.md
- If community behavior issues occur, follow CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md guidelines
- For git issues, refer to the git workflow documentation in CONTRIBUTING.md
```

### Rules

- Use present tense ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("move cursor to..." not "moves cursor to...")
- Don't capitalize first letter
- No period at the end
- Keep subject line under 72 characters
- Include WHY, WHAT, Web Impact, and Failure Mode sections
- Wrap body text at 72 characters
- See [GIT.md](GIT.md) for more examples and details
